## Before to develop

Before to code the component, we should define:

- if there exists a developed Common UX component [here](https://commonux.abb.com/),
- the name of the component, it's module and it's attributes,
- **how to use it as pure HTML tag or class.**

## Deliverables

Every components should deliver at least the following files:

- component.directive.js: directive
- component.html: html template
- component.less: the style
- component.spec.js: unit test
- [readme.md](): general documentation
- [javascript.md](): an example about how to use the component (js)
- [html.md](): an example about how to use the component (html)

## Design Patterns

We believe in the principles of software developement (at least):

- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

and a strong understanding of [GOF Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) is recommended.

The review of the component will be done following these principles and software engineering good practises.
